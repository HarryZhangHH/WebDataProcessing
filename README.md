## Utilizing LSTM Model and Ensemble Algorithm to Detect Fake News
In the past many years, as the Internet has promoted the rapid development of information exchange,
the spread of fake news has increased rapidly. This phenomenon is particularly obvious in the politi-
cal and economic fields. The dissemination of this inconsistent information has caused many serious
problems and bring negative influence in politics, economics and various other fields. Fake news may
bring disastrous consequences and may plunge society into a serious crisis.
We intend to use mature datasets (i.e., record title and text of different news) of fake news and
real news to train appropriate Neural Network Models (e.g., LSTM, Bi-LSTM and etc.) to complete
the classification of fake news and use the test set to verify the accuracy of model’s classification.
Considering that most previous works only analyze the title of news or the text of news, we propose
to establish a suitable method, which can utilize both title and text, based on LSTM or Bi-LSTM.
